# Single cycle CPU design

 Main archetecture is based on:
 
 https://blog.csdn.net/Accelerato/article/details/86546751 .

 Some designs are inspired from :
 
 https://github.com/freemso/cpu-verilog/blob/master/cpu/cpu.srcs/sources_1/new/cpu.v ,
 
 https://github.com/liuqdev/8-bits-RISC-CPU-Verilog . 
 
 # Testbench
 I tested each unit of the single cycle CPU with a testbench. The prefix "tb" means the testbench of each corresponding unit.
