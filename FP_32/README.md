# Floating-Point Unit 
This project is a simple 32-bit FPU design including multiplier,adder/subtractor, FMA, and SRT divider.

# To-Do
 1. 64-bit FPU would be designed.
 2. 16-bit FPU would be designed 
 3. Rounding is not considered temporarily. âˆš
 4. Floating-point Matrix Multiply would be designed based on the FMA.
